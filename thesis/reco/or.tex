Various object in ATLAS are reconstructed in separate steps using the same detector information. Due to this, different object reconstruction algorithms do not know what information is used to create other objects, allowing for the same energy deposit in the calorimeters to be used to construction different objects, resulting in double counting of the same energy deposit. To counteract this, an overlap removal scheme has been developed to compare different objects to see if that is a geometric overlap between them. If there is overlap one of the objects will be removed depending on a pre-defined criteria. The criteria for this will be discussed further in Section~\ref{sec:reco_VH_object_selection}.
