As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:hl_lhc}, the LHC will be upgraded to the High-Luminosity LHC in between Runs 3 and 4 and is expected to deliver a pileup of $\langle \mu \rangle \approx 200$~\cite{Schmidt:2016jra}. This pileup is approximately four times larger than the Run 3 average, producing a complex and challenging environment for particle reconstruction. Additionally, track reconstruction will become the most computationally intensive part of event reconstruction due to execution time scaling quadratically with charge particle multiplicity. To handle the increasing pileup, a fast, simple, and clean software framework is needed for muon reconstruction.
