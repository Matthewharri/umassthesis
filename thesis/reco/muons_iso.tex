Muon isolation is handled similarly to electron isolation as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:reco_electron_iso}. In summary, the isolation is based off of track-based and calorimeter-based isolation variable, each computed using a cone of size $\Delta R = 0.2$ around the muon object. An additional isolation variable can be used which is derived from the particle-flow reconstruction method~\cite{ATLAS:2017ghe}, that combines the track-based and calorimeter-based isolation variables into a single variable.
