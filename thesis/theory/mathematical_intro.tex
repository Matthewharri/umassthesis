% To understand the mathematical foundation that the Standard Model is built upon, it is necessary to start with the basic mathematical principles that the Standard Model is based on. In this Section we will introduce what a group is, and how groups describe symmetries. Then, we will discuss Lie groups, which define the symmetries of the Standard Model. Finally, we will discuss gauge symmetries and the U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) groups that are used in the Standard Model. 
% This section begins by introducing the concept of a group, which provides a mathematical description of symmetry. We then move on to Lie groups which define the symmetries of the Standard Model. Finally, we present the groups U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) as examples of Lie groups that will later appear in physical contexts. Their specific roles in quantum field theories will be discussed in detail in Sections~\ref{sec:theory_qed},~\ref{sec:theory_qcd} and~\ref{sec:theory_ew}.Sections~\ref{sec:theory_qed},~\ref{sec:theory_qcd} and~\ref{sec:theory_ew}.
This section provides a brief introduction to the mathematical concepts essential for deriving the Standard Model Lagrangian, including groups, Lie groups, and gauge symmetries. While the mathematical formalism is not the focus of this thesis, it is necessary for a deeper understanding of the Standard Model.
