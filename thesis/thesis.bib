	abstract = {A magnet system of three superconducting toroids and a solenoid with record overall system dimensions of 25m in length and 22m in diameter, generate the magnetic field for particle bending in, respectively, the muon and inner detectors in the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The magnet technology is based on aluminum stabilized NbTi superconducting cables wound into impregnated windings which are conduction cooled and operate at 4.6K. Magnetic field is generated in the usable detector area of about 12000m3 and the peak field in the coil windings is 4.1T. The magnet system stored energy is 1.6GJ. After successful on-surface tests the magnets were installed in the ATLAS cavern 100m underground. The Barrel Toroid and Solenoid were charged to full field in autumn 2006 while both End Cap Toroids are powered in November 2007 thereby completing this very challenging and largest magnet system successfully constructed so far.},

@article{atlas_calorimeter_supercell,
	abstract = {Liquid argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters are employed by ATLAS for all electromagnetic calorimetry in the pseudo-rapidity region |η|<3.2, and for hadronic and forward calorimetry in the region from |η|=1.5 to |η|=4.9. In the LHC Run 2 about 150 fb-1 of data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV have been recorded. The well calibrated and highly granular LAr Calorimeter reached its design values both in energy measurement as well as in direction resolution. Electronics developments are pursued for the trigger readout of the ATLAS LAr Calorimeter towards the Phase-I upgrade scheduled in the LHC shut-down period between December 2018 and early 2021. Trigger signals with finer spatial granularity and higher precision are needed in order to improve the identification efficiencies of electrons, photons, taus, jets and missing energy, at high background rejection rates, already at the Level-1 trigger. Following new TDAQ buffering requirements and high expected radiation doses in the pileup conditions of the high-luminosity LHC, the LAr Calorimeter electronics will be further upgraded (Phase-II) to readout the full 182,500 calorimeter cells at 40 MHz with 16 bit dynamic range. Developments of low-power preamplifiers and shapers to meet these requirements are ongoing in 130 nm CMOS. In order to digitize the analogue signals on two gains after shaping, radiation-hard, low-power 40 MHz 14-bit ADCs are developed using a SAR architecture in 65 nm CMOS. This contribution gives an overview of the detector operation, changes in the monitoring and data quality procedures, to cope with increased pileup, as well as the achieved performance. Results of ASIC developments including quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) and radiation hardness evaluations, performances of the pre-production boards and results of the system integration tests, progress of QA/QC of final production boards are presented along with the overall system design for the Phase-I upgrade. Results of tests of the first prototypes of front-end components are presented, along with design studies on the performance of the off-detector readout system for the Phase-II upgrade.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive review of the Hough transform, HT, in image processing and computer vision. It has long been recognized as a technique of almost unique promise for shape and motion analysis in images containing noisy, missing, and extraneous data but its adoption has been slow due to its computational and storage complexity and the lack of a detailed understanding of its properties. However, in recent years much progress has been made in these areas. In this review we discuss ideas for the efficient implementation of the HT and present results on the analytic and empirical performance of various methods. We also report the relationship of Hough methods and other transforms and consider applications in which the HT has been used. It seems likely that the HT will be an increasingly used technique and we hope that this survey will provide a useful guide to quickly acquaint researchers with the main literature in this research area.},

	abstract = {The algorithms used by the ATLAS Collaboration during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider to identify jets containing b-hadrons are presented. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated in the simulation and the efficiency with which these algorithms identify jets containing b-hadrons is measured in collision data. The measurement uses a likelihood-based method in a sample highly enriched in {\$}{\$}t{\{}{$\backslash$}bar{\{}t{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$} events. The topology of the {\$}{\$}t {$\backslash$}rightarrow W b{\$}{\$} decays is exploited to simultaneously measure both the jet flavour composition of the sample and the efficiency in a transverse momentum range from 20 to 600 GeV. The efficiency measurement is subsequently compared with that predicted by the simulation. The data used in this measurement, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 80.5 {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}hbox {\{}fb{\}}\^{}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}, were collected in proton--proton collisions during the years 2015--2017 at a centre-of-mass energy {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}sqrt{\{}s{\}}={\$}{\$} 13 TeV. By simultaneously extracting both the efficiency and jet flavour composition, this measurement significantly improves the precision compared to previous results, with uncertainties ranging from 1 to 8{\%} depending on the jet transverse momentum.},

	abstract = {The performance of the missing transverse momentum ({\$}{\$}E{\_}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}T{\}}{\}}\^{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}miss{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}) reconstruction with the ATLAS detector is evaluated using data collected in proton--proton collisions at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2015. To reconstruct {\$}{\$}E{\_}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}T{\}}{\}}\^{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}miss{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}, fully calibrated electrons, muons, photons, hadronically decaying {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}tau {$\backslash$}text {\{}-leptons{\}}{\$}{\$}, and jets reconstructed from calorimeter energy deposits and charged-particle tracks are used. These are combined with the soft hadronic activity measured by reconstructed charged-particle tracks not associated with the hard objects. Possible double counting of contributions from reconstructed charged-particle tracks from the inner detector, energy deposits in the calorimeter, and reconstructed muons from the muon spectrometer is avoided by applying a signal ambiguity resolution procedure which rejects already used signals when combining the various {\$}{\$}E{\_}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}T{\}}{\}}\^{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}miss{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}contributions. The individual terms as well as the overall reconstructed {\$}{\$}E{\_}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}T{\}}{\}}\^{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}miss{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}are evaluated with various performance metrics for scale (linearity), resolution, and sensitivity to the data-taking conditions. The method developed to determine the systematic uncertainties of the {\$}{\$}E{\_}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}T{\}}{\}}\^{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}miss{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}scale and resolution is discussed. Results are shown based on the full 2015 data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of {\$}{\$}3.2\~{}{$\backslash$}hbox {\{}fb{\}}\^{}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}.},
