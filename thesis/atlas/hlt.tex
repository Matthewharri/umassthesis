The High Level Trigger (HLT) is the second stage of the ATLAS trigger system. It is a software based, asynchronous distributed computing system designed to reduce event rates from the 75 kHz output of the L1 trigger to about 200 Hz. The HLT is split into the two components: the Level-2 (L2) trigger which reduces event rates to about 2 kHz and the Event Filter (EF) which further reduces event rates to the final target of 200 Hz. Unlike the L1 trigger, both L2 and EF have access to the full granularity of the data collected from the detector. While these triggers are afforded more time for decision making, they still must make decisions quickly enough to maintain the output rate from the L1 trigger. The L2 trigger must make a decision in about 40 ms, and the EF in under 4 seconds. However, CPU allocation is dynamic between L2 and EF thus these timing constraints are more flexible than strict.
