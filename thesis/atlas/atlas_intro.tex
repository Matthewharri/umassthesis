% The ATLAS experiment, in its current form, was first proposed in 1994~\cite{atlas_technical_proposal}, with official funding from CERN member states following in 1995. Construction began in 2003 and was completed in 2008. ATLAS is the largest of the LHC's detectors, measuring 46 meters in length, 25 meters in diameter, and weighing over 7,000 tonnes. It has a symmetric, cylindrical geometry designed to provide nearly full solid-angle coverage about the collision point. The detector is made up of several subsystems arranged as concentric cylindrical layers aligned with the beam pipe. These are further divided into three main regions: the central barrel and two endcaps at either end.

% The innermost component of ATLAS is the Inner Detector (ID), which is responsible for tracking charged particles and reconstructing the primary vertex (PV). The ID consists of three technologies: the high-granularity silicon pixel detector situated closest to the interaction point, followed by the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT), and finally the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT). Surrounding the ID is the calorimeter system, split into the electromagnetic calorimeter, which measures particles like electrons and photons, and the hadronic calorimeter, which captures energy from hadrons such as pions and neutrons. The outermost subsystem is the muon spectrometer, which identifies and measures the momentum of muons, the only charged particles capable of penetrating the entire detector.
% The ID is explained in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:atlas_id}, the calorimeter system in Section~\ref{sec:atlas_calorimeter}, and the muon spectrometer in Section~\ref{sec:atlas_muon}. The entire ATLAS detector can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_detector}.

The ATLAS experiment was first proposed in 1994~\cite{atlas_technical_proposal} and officially funded in 1995 with construction spanning from 2003 to 2008. It is the largest LHC detector, measuring 46 meters in length, 25 meters in diameter, and weighing over 7,000 tonnes. Its symmetric cylindrical geometry provides nearly full solid-angle coverage around the collision point. ATLAS is composed of several concentric subsystems aligned with the beam pipe, divided into a central barrel and two endcaps.

The innermost component is the Inner Detector (ID), which is responsible for tracking charged particles and reconstructing the primary vertex (PV). It consists of three different detector technologies: the high-granularity silicon pixel detector, the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT), and the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT). Surrounding the ID is the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter systems which measures the energy of particles like electrons, photons, and hadrons. The outermost subsystem is the muon spectrometer which identifies and measures the momentum of muons as only those penetrate the entire detector.
Further details on the ID, calorimeters, and muon spectrometers are provided in Sections~\ref{sec:atlas_id},~\ref{sec:atlas_calorimeter},~\ref{sec:atlas_muon} respectively. The entire ATLAS detector can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_detector}.
