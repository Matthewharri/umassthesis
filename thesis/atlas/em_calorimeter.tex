% The ECal is the inner most layer of the calorimeter system, surrounding the entire ID\@. As mentioned in the previous section, the ECal is a LAr based calorimeter where the active material is liquid argon and the passive absorbers are lead plates. Lead absorbers are chosen due to the high atomic number of the material resulting in a small $X_0$. The barrel region ($|\eta| < 1.475$) consists of two half barrels centered around the beam axis, with each half barrel consisting of 16 modules. The half barrels are separated from one another at $z = 0$ with a 4 mm gap. Each end-cap consists of two co-axial wheels, that are divided into eight modules, and cover the region $1.375 < |\eta| < 3.2$. Between the IP and calorimeter, there is approximately 1.7 \radlength, so to account for possible energy loss by electrons and photons a liquid-argon pre-sampler with resolution $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.1 \times 0.025$ is placed in front of calorimeters in the range $|\eta| < 1.8$, allowing for an improved energy measurement. In the barrel and end-caps of the ECal, the lead absorbers and electrodes are accordion in shape, allowing for full coverage in $\varphi$. This accordion geometry, as well as the alternating pattern of liquid argon and lead, is seen in figure.~\ref{fig:atlas_calorimeter_accordion}. Overall, the ECal has a total of 180,000 readout channels. 

% A LAr module consists of three different layers, with increasing granularity as distance from the IP increases\@. The first of these layers is the strip cells which have a resolution of $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.1 \times 0.0031$, and extends for 4.3 \radlength{} before the second layer. The second layer consists of square cells with a resolution of $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.025 \times 0.025$, and extends for at least 16.0 \radlength{} before reaching the third layer. This is the primary energy-depositing layer where the majority of the EM shower is absorbed. The third layer consists of coarser cells with a resolution of $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.025 \times 0.05$, spanning approximately 2 \radlength. It is important to note that these \radlength{} correspond to $\eta = 0$ but differ depending on barrel $\eta$. Additionally, the third layer consists of even larger cells with a resolution of $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.1 \times 0.1$, known as ``Trigger Towers'' (TTs), which were used in the Level-1 (L1) trigger system during the first two runs. For Run 3, the TT's are replaced\footnote{Technically, the TT's were not replaced but were supplemented with another technology that was meant to replace them eventually. The TT's were finally turned off in the middle of data taking in 2024.} with the new SuperCells that provide a more granular resolution. A comparison between the TT's and SuperCells can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_super_cells}. Unlike the TT's, the SuperCells consists of four layers of varying granularity. The first layer (Layer 0), corresponding to the pre-sampler, has the same granularity as TT's of $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.1 \times 0.1$. Layers 1 and 2 have a granularity as small as $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.025 \times 0.1$, and the final layer returns to $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.1 \times 0.1$. These changes allow for improved trigger algorithms, and provide a better definition of energy showers in the calorimeter. The trigger system will be discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:atlas_trigger}. A sketch of a barrel module with the different layers can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_calorimeter_module}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Revision

The ECal is the innermost layer of the calorimeter system, surrounds the ID and uses LAr as active material and lead as its passive. Lead absorbers are chosen for their high atomic number resulting in a small $X_0$. 

The barrel region ($|\eta| < 1.475$) consists of two half barrels each with 16 modules and are separated by a 4 mm gap at $z = 0$. Each end-cap covers $1.375 < |\eta| < 3.2$ with two co-axial wheels split into eight modules. A liquid-argon pre-sampler with resolution $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.1 \times 0.025$ is placed in front of the calorimeter and covers $|\eta| < 1.8$ to correct for the energy loss due to the 1.7 \radlength{} between the IP and calorimeter. 

Combined, the barrel and end-caps of the ECal contain 180,000 readout channels and have the lead absorbers and electrodes in accordion shapes, allowing for full coverage in $\varphi$. The accordion geometry and sampling calorimeter nature can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_calorimeter_accordion}.

The LAr modules, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_calorimeter_module}, consist of three layers with decreasing granularity as distance from the IP increases:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \setlength\parskip{0pt}
    \item Layer 1: Strip cells with resolution $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.1 \times 0.0031$, spans 4.3 \radlength{}
    \item Layer 2: Square cells with resolution $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.025 \times 0.025$, spans at least 16.0 \radlength{}
    \item Layer 3: Coarser cells with resolution $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.025 \times 0.05$, spans approximately 2 \radlength{}
\end{itemize}

The given \radlength{} correspond to $\eta = 0$ but differ depending on barrel $\eta$. Additionally, the third layer consists of Trigger Towers (TTs) with a resolution of $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.1 \times 0.1$, which were used in the Level-1 (L1) in Runs 1--2. In Run 3, they have been replaced\footnote{TTs were initially supplemented by these, but have since been disabled in 2024.} by SuperCells as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_super_cells}, which have four layers of varying granularity:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \setlength\parskip{0pt}
    \item Layer 0: Pre-sampler with resolution $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.1 \times 0.1$
    \item Layers 1,2: Resolution $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.025 \times 0.1$
    \item Layer 3: Resolution $\Delta\varphi \times \Delta\eta = 0.1 \times 0.1$.
\end{itemize}
These changes allow for better trigger resolution and shower shape discrimination. The trigger will be discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:atlas_trigger}.
